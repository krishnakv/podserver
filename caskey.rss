<p>In today's Mailbag Monday episode, veteran sales trainers Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale respond to a question from a listener about selling opportunity vs. selling pain.  </p>
<p>Do you quiz your prospects with questions to identify where they’re struggling the most?  </p>
<p>Are you looking for things in their answers that will lead you to a deal?  </p>
<p>In this episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill and Bryan focus on the new school way of selling— asking questions to determine if you and your prospect should work together. A whole new approach to a very old tactic can help you focus on what your prospect is moving toward, instead of what they’re running from. Do you think pain-finding is on the outs? We’d love to hear what you think too.  </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When you hear “Broker,” do you think “Middle Man” or “Middle Woman?” In today’s Mailbag Monday episode, veteran sales trainers Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale dive into two questions from Craig in Chicago.  </p>
<p>Do you diminish an interaction because someone is “just the broker?”  </p>
<p>If you ARE the broker, do you know how to communicate to your prospect that the sales process is better with you in it than it is without you?  </p>
<p>In this episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill and Bryan give you tactical steps to help you redefine the role and opportunity of a broker relationship. They also look at Craig’s second question about renegotiating contracts. Bryan defines the best way for you to open a conversation with a prospect, and Bill gives you a huge idea to help you visually depict your value to a customer.  </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever used the saying “Be careful what you wish for?” Veteran sales trainers Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale welcome in the new year with a discussion around the all-too-common request from salespeople everywhere: a larger territory.</p>
<p>How do you build, support, manage and retain a bigger client base, especially when your resources or distance to the customer may not change as the territory expands.</p>
<p>Do you know who to call on most? How do you decide which accounts get more attention?</p>
<p>In today’s episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill and Bryan ask a longtime listener and podcast client for his best practices while sharing some of their own. Bill teaches you one of his client’s easiest ways to help keep the feeling of personalized attention when you have lots of clients to manage. Bryan shows you how to develop your own “balanced scorecard” to determine how to divide your time and attention.  </p>
<p>Their guest, Craig, kicks it with an old-school (and still works) technique to make sure your customers know you’re thinking about them when you can’t drop in.  Start your new year off right— and be ready to take notes.  </p>

<p>No one would ever admit that they did anything to stop a buyer from buying from them. Yet, salespeople do it all the time. We like to say there are things you do to “propel” the sale. And things you do to “repel” the sale. In this podcast, Bill addresses the very things most salespeople do.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We all know it— the old school “cookbook” model of selling is dead. Veteran sales trainers Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale explore a new model <span class="__postbox-detected-content __postbox-detected-date">today—</span> living in an “outbound” sales world.  </p>
<p>Are you still chasing people around, burning a lot of calories and not getting the results you want?</p>
<p>Are you making 30 calls a day and reminding yourself “the action is on the <span class="__postbox-detected-content __postbox-detected-date">29th</span> call”?</p>
<p>In this episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill and Bryan show you a different way focused on outbound, leveraged behaviors. They will help you learn how to shift your mentality from “how do I go get” to “how do I draw in” and why doing so will create more demand for your product. When people chase you, the process changes. You will go from selling people to helping people and never look back.</p>

Veteran sales trainers Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale dive deep into a conversation about the importance of creating real value for others with Jordan Harbinger, host of popular <em>The Art of Charm </em>podcast.  They discuss Jordan’s recommendations for salespeople who want to get serious about incorporating real, meaningful interactions with others into their sales process.  Are you thinking about how you show up in front of your prospects and how to demonstrate your personal value?  Is your mindset helping or hurting you?  Jordan says these are key to being charming (and successful) in your sales career and your personal life.  In this episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill and Bryan take Jordan’s best practices and apply them to sales.  You may be surprised just how similar the principles are to the “Inner Game” concepts you’ve heard Bill and Bryan discuss for years.  </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It seems there is ALWAYS price resistance. Seldom do you give the prospect the price and they say, "Is that all it is?" In business-to-business selling, there seems to always be a smidge of resistance. So what do you do? And more importantly, where does it come from?</p>
<p>Bill and Bryan dig into this important topic for sales people and sales managers in the episode. Afterwords, Brooke Green joins them to answer a question from a LinkedIn group member:<br /><em>What is the best way to approach a referral source and ask for a testimonial of our service that we can use for online marketing? I'm new to this area and feel odd asking for a testimonial, but they must value our service, because they send clients!</em><br /><br /><strong>Also mentioned in this podcast:</strong></p>

<p><em>"I love doing complimentary bonuses when selling someone else's product. I'm selling a language product online now, but can't think of a bonus that would: </em></p>
<ul>
<li><em> be relevant to the niche</em></li>

<li><em>be enticing enough to make it worth the purchase by itself"</em></li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We have a LinkedIn group member guest this week, Ali El Jishi from Bahrain.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the first of a two-part series of our interview with Coach Lin Dunn of the Indianapolis Fever of the WNBA. Now, you're probably wondering, "What does the WNBA have to do with my business success?" Well, maybe nothing…however…if you haven't heard Lin Dunn speak before, you're in for a treat. She has been successful as a coach at every level of women's basketball. And her message with Brooke and Bill has little to do with basketball and a lot to do with the "attributes of success."

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">Ever wonder how buyers think? What goes through their mind when they decide what vendor to use? Well, you're in luck today. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande';"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">We have a very special guest on the podcast this week-Paul Rogers, a procurement expert from Australia.  Paul has been in purchasing for over 30 years and works with procurement people to help them work better with vendor sales teams. He also works with sales teams as well helping them to position their value in a more compelling way. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande';"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">We thought he'd be a great resource for our podcast listeners. So, in this episode, Bill and Bryan pose some very basic questions to him about how buyers see the world. If you call on professional procurement people, this is a great episode to hear. This is the first in an ongoing series with Paul. Would love to hear your feedback on our LinkedIn Group. </p>

			<link><![CDATA[https://billcaskey01.libsyn.com/how-to-learn-from-a-lost-deal]]></link>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>One of our most popular training modules is when we "dissect the deal." It's usually is done on a deal that is still live, meaning the client has not made a decision, "Yes" or "No."</p>
<p>But this episode is different, more of a post-mortem on a deal that one of our clients, Stephanie, lost. She was kind enough to volunteer to be in the spotlight at the recent Jazz Kitchen Event.</p>
<p>In this episode, Stephanie tells Bryan and Brooke about the situation and then fields questions from them and the audience. <br />If you don't have another person in your life that can help you sort through the sales deals you're in, then you'll learn how to do it (to yourself) here.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's podcast addresses a question from a listener who wanted to know how to begin the sales process when they had very little in terms of case studies, or customer experience. In his case, it was a start-up company in the IT space.</p>
<p>Bill and Bryan dished out some tips to use in beginning to position him in the market. The fact is that, in some ways, this is an excellent position to be in. The ability to create a position from scratch can be quite powerful.</p>
<p>However, if you already have a customer base and are a seasoned pro, there are still some ideas in this podcast that will help you re-think your position.</p>
<p>The fact is that even if we've been around for a while, there is always something new we're wanting to do - new products - innovative services - new ways to think about old problems. Consequently, "thinking like a beginner" is something we should do frequently.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Brooke Green joins Bill and Bryan to address the issue of how to sell if you’re an ‘accidental salesperson.’ Brooke works with quite a few companies and people, who don’t consider themselves salespeople, yet who are still responsible for new business development.</p>
<p>This includes accountants, engineers, subject matter experts, consultants, technical advisors, project managers, entrepreneurs or others who would be classified as ‘accidentals.’ Heck, even some sales people might put themselves in that position.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We've all received it - that email that comes, ominously, from someone you hoped to work with. It's the email that says, "Thanks, but no thanks." And it's like a punch to the gut.</p>
<p>Well, that all may be overly dramatic, but the fact is that we all have received the 'ding letter' whether it's an actual letter or not.</p>
<p>In this podcast, Bill and Bryan address, 'what to do' when you're about to be dinged.</p>
<p><strong>Rant Line</strong></p>
<p>In this episode, Bill and Bryan mentioned the addition of the RANT LINE for listeners of the podcast.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode, Bill and Bryan address something you should always share with your prospects (and clients, too). It has to do with your "why" in business.</p>

We think it applies directly to sales people - and this podcast explains how to share this with your clients and prospects.</p>

<p>In the first scenario, the discussion centers around how to achieve the feeling of 'abundance.' The second scenario deals with how to achieve the goals you set - and how you know if you're on the right path.</p>

The key element of all this is that if you’re not watching trends, then they can slip up on you and pass you by. So, if your sales and revenues are not where they need to be or could be, then you might be a victim of old thinking. (29:54)]]></description>

They spend a few minutes on each question--and of course, a few minutes trying to bring humor to the episode. You can also see this episode on YouTube.

The premise for this episode is that most sales teams don’t work - or at least they aren’t optimized. We’ll talk
about how to look at, and assess, your sales team so you know where to focus your attention – and how to 
grow your business. This is for Sales VP’s, Sales Managers, Regional Managers or anyone who manages/oversees

Or, maybe you learned the “‘trial close.” Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale address

The issue of closing skills in this podcast – yet they don’t address it in the traditional way.

 

In fact, they lay to rest - hopefully forever – the idea that by delivering certain techniques

you can “get someone to make a decision.” That’s not the way it works – and to reinforce

those worn out sales tactics does you more harm than good. 

 

This podcast will rewire your sales mind a little – which 

will allow you to operate from a different mental position when getting decisions.]]></description>

			<link><![CDATA[https://billcaskey01.libsyn.com/the_economic_buyer]]></link>
			<description><![CDATA[In this week's episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale discuss how to appeal to the economic buyer. In their consulting practice, it never fails that one of the biggest challenges for sales people is "selling to groups."

The bottom line is that everyone in the group MUST be on the page. However, the economic buyer (the person in charge of money) is one most likely to have their own style of buying that may or may not match up with yours. Bill and Bryan give you new ways to think about these problems that come up over and over to help the economic buyer get away from the price page, and onto everyone else's page.  This is a very crucial part of the selling cycle that can make or break most deals.   

If you want to call in and have your question answered by Bill and Bryan, call 317.722.6299. Use your first name only.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[In this week's episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale discuss how to overcome your fears of cold calling and prospecting.  In sales, the majority of the business you generate is from calling on new prospects. Even though those first phone calls are some of the most dreaded parts of sales, they CAN be mastered. And like we say, 'make your biggest weakness your biggest asset' and watch success ensure. The mind is telling you something if you have fear. It tells you "you aren't looking at the situation "correctly." Caskey and Neale help you change your thinking around these aspects of sales so the "phobia" evaporates.

			<description><![CDATA[This episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast is the second in a series that began last week.  In this episode Bill and Bryan
discuss your “comfort zone.” We all are very aware of what is inside and outside of our comfort zones.  Bill and Bryan want you to step just a little bit outside of that comfort zone; to what they call, “the warning zone”.  In the "warning zone" your mind is telling you that you are somewhat uncomfortable in the situation you're in.  One of the best ways to step out of your comfort zone is to talk about money right off the bat.  Get your price on the table so that during the first meeting you will know if there is any reason to proceed after this call. The lesson here is: stop wasting time trying to sell them something that they can’t afford--or don't want to afford. After that, you can slowly build more confidence doing other things outside of your comfort zone, thereby creating a larger comfort zone, which will enable you to achieve more during a sales call.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[In this week's episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill Caskey  and Bryan Neale talk about ending sales calls with a good understanding of what is going to happen next, instead of letting the  deal become stalled.  So how do you do this?  It's pretty simple, at  the end of a sales call, you need to know if you and the prospect are  going to continue moving along with this deal, or if this just isn't  going to work.  This is very important for you, because it will help you waste less time on deals that might not happen, and allow you to have more time to spend on the ones that will happen.  There are many  other vital parts to this process in this episode, so don't miss it.  Please feel free to contact us at listener@advancedsellingpodcast.com  or on our new toll free number,1-877-637-8853.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year from all of us at The Advanced Selling Podcast! We decided 
that in order to get you off on the right 
foot this year, we would discuss the rules that all sales people should abide by: "The Commandments of Selling". Most sales training deals with what to say. But in the commandments, we deal with sales strategy and modern thought. 

Everyone needs standards and rules to keep us on track--physically and 
mentally-- during the selling process. This week Bill and Bryan give you their version of the commandments. If you get this urge to share an additional commandment, call us at 317-722-6299 or email us at

			<description><![CDATA[When salespeople walk into a company for a sales call, they don't always realize the landscape they're about to experience.

Salespeople need to understand the people inside the company--those stressed and overworked souls. And the executives you're meeting with don't seem to
put much focus on communicating the company vision to their staff. Therefore, few know it.

Therefore, when meeting with these executives, your job as a salesperson is to engage them in conversation about the company's and their pains, and their visions  for the future.
By discussing this, you and your prospect will have a better understanding if your product or service will be a perfect fit.

			<description><![CDATA[In this week's episode of The Advanced Selling Podcast, Bill Caskey and Bryan Neale discuss the problems associated with being too enthusiastic about your product/service. The problem is that your enthusiasm can get in the way of focusing on helping your prospect solve their problem. Enthusiasm in sales is OK, as long as you're more excited about helping your client solve his problem than you are about your product. When you show up at a prospect's office and the only thing that you're excited about is closing a deal, the prospect senses that --  thereby raising their BS detector. This is a perfect episode for the "technical seller." Pass it on to your technical team, if you have one.]]></description>
